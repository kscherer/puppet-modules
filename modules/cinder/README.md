# The cinder module

This module can be used to flexibly configure [cinder](http://wiki.openstack.org/Cinder), the Block Storage Service of OpenStack.

It has been tested with a combination of other modules, and has primarily been developed as a subcomponent of the [openstack module](https://github.com/stackforge/puppet-openstack)

This version of the module is targeted at Folsom and Grizzly.
